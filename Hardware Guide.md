#### Frame Set-Up

**Material**  

* Landing Gear (x4)
* Arms (x4) [Red (x2) & White (x2)]
* Power Distribution Base
* Upper Base
* E310 Motors (x4)
* E310 ESCs (x4)
* Motor Screws
* Landing Gear Screws
* Frame Screws
* Thick Black/Red Cable
* Battery Connector
* Electrical Tape

1. Attach the Arms to the Upper Base using the Frame Screws. The color of the Arms should be the same so that you can distinguish between front and back.
1. Observe the arrows direction on each of the motors. There should be two pointing left and two point right.
1. Attach each motor to an arm using the motor screws so that the same colored arms have the different directional motors.
    * Make sure that the cables from the motor are facing along the arm in the direction towards the other end.
    * The motor screws are the ones with the thicker width and longer length compared to the frame screws.
1. Place connected parts upside down resting lightly on the motor heads.
1. Take the Power Distribution Base and place it aligned with the bottom of the arms so that the +/- symbols are also facing the floor.
1. Using the landing gear screws attach the legs to the arms through the power distribution base.
1. The ESCs can be connected to the motors and attached to the arms with electrical tape.
1. Now the other end of the ESCs must be connected to the +/- symbols located behind the arms on the power distribution board via soldering.
    * Solder each of the red/black cables to the respective +/- slots (there should be one remaining)
    * The remaining +/- symbol is for the battery connection.
1. Before connecting the cables to the distribution board they need to be attached to a proper battery connector.
1. Solder the battery connector to the thick black and red cables such that they properly represent the battery connections.
1. Solder the other end of the thick black and red cables to the last +/- slot on the power distribution cable.
